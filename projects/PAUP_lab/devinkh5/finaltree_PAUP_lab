>Bootstrap method with heuristic search:
>  Number of bootstrap replicates = 100
>  Starting seed = generated automatically
>  Number of characters resampled in each replicate = 1281
>  Optimality criterion = likelihood
>    All characters have equal weight
>    Likelihood settings:
>                      Substitution types = 2 (HKY85 variant)
>                             Ti/tv ratio = estimated
>                       State frequencies = estimated
>          Proportion of invariable sites = none
>                 Rates at variable sites = gamma, shape=estimated (4 categories [mean])
>                    Model correspondence = HKY85+G
>
>      Number of distinct data patterns under this model = 77
>      Molecular clock not enforced
>      Starting branch lengths obtained using Rogers-Swofford approximation method
>      Trees with approximate log likelihoods 5% or further from the target score are rejected without additional iteration
>      Branch-length optimization = one-dimensional Newton-Raphson with pass limit=20, tolerance=1e-07
>      Multidimensional optimizer = Praxis (tol=0.0001)
>      Likelihood calculations performed in single precision
>      Vector processing enabled
>      Conditional-likelihood rescaling threshold = 1e-20
>
>  Starting tree(s) obtained via stepwise addition
>    Addition sequence: as-is
>    Number of trees held at each step = 1
>  Branch-swapping algorithm: nearest-neighbor interchange (NNI)
>    Steepest descent option not in effect
>  Initial 'Maxtrees' setting = 100
>  Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if branch length is less than or equal to 1e-08
>  'MulTrees' option in effect
>  No topological constraints in effect
>  Trees are unrooted
>
>  100 bootstrap replicates completed
>  Time used = 00:02:31 (CPU time = 00:02:31.6)
