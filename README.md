Textbooks: None are required, readings will be provided from the primary
literature, as well as from the following texts. Purchase of these texts
is optional, though both are great reference material for those
interested in phylogenetics and phylogenetic methods.

Baum, David A. and Stacey D. Smith. *Tree Thinking: An Introduction to
Phylogenetic Biology* (1st Edition). W.H. Freeman, 2012.

Felsenstein, Joseph. *Inferring Phylogenies* (2nd Edition). Sinauer,
2003.

**Course Description: **

Phylogenetic trees are the map by which we understand evolutionary
history and ultimately, all of biology. The goals of this course are
threefold:

1.  **Embrace tree-thinking:** You will learn what a phylogeny
    represents, how to use them to interpret evolutionary history and
    importantly, how to estimate them from biological data. This is the
    study of *phylogenetics.*

2.  **Unleash the power of the comparative method:** Why should we
    estimate trees in the first place? We will use phylogenies as a map
    for studying macroevolutionary questions about trait evolution, the
    relationships between organisms and their abiotic and biotic
    environment, and the causes and consequences of diversification.
    This is the study of *phylogenetic comparative methods*.

3.  **Think big - Macroevolutionary science:** We will engage with the
    rich and exciting history of evolutionary thought which
    fundamentally sought to unite microevolutionary processes, genetics
    and development to explain macroevolutionary patterns across the
    tree of life. We will read and discuss about these “big ideas” in
    macroevolution, and discuss how recent advances in phylogenetics and
    comparative methods enable us to test these ideas in ways never
    before possible.

**Course Policies**

*Attendance*

You are expected to attend every class and be on time. You are expected
to participate in all discussions, have completed all readings BEFORE
class, and to fully engage with the material and your classmates.

*Course Syllabus*

The course syllabus is subject to change by the instructor. Changes will
be announced in class and on Canvas. Exam dates are unlikely to be
changed from their original version.

*Student Evaluation*

Exams (2 X 100 pts, 200pts)

Participation in discussions of primary literature (50 pts)

Exercises (5 assignments, each worth 10 pts, 50 pts)

Final Project: Final project presentation(100 pts)

*Final Project Description.* All course participants will conduct an
final research project that will conduct an analysis of phylogenetic
data using the methods and techniques learned in class. This project is
largely open-ended and up to the student. However, suggested topics
include: building a phylogeny of a group of taxa of interest using
available sequence data on Genbank, analyzing existing phenotypic
datasets and phylogenies with phylogenetic comparative methods, or
conducting a simulation study of phylogenetic model behavior. One of the
5 assignments is to submit a project proposal (due 10/1) that outlines
the research question under study, the proposed datasets to be used, the
analyses to be conducted, and the expected results (No more than 2
pages, not including citations). The last two class periods will be
spent for final presentations in the form of 15 minute talks on the
results of these independent research projects.
